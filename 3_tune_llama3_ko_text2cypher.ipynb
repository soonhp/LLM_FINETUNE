They involve sophisticated filtering conditions and logical operations to extract nuanced insights from interconnected data points. An example could be finding all 'Person' nodes who work in a 'Department' with over 50 employees and have at least one 'REPORTS_TO' relationship. Always limit the number of results if more than one row is expected from the questions by saying 'first 3' or 'top 5' elements\",\n",

Always limit the number of results if more than one row is expected from the questions by saying 'first 3' or 'top 5' elements\",\n",
