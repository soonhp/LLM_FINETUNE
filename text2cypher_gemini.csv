"Find the movies that have a synopsis that contains ""대학 시간강사인 고윤주"" and were directed by ""봉준호"" and where ""이성재"" acted, and whose synopsis is longer than 100 characters.",neo4j,"<explanation>
This query finds movies that satisfy the following criteria:

1. **Synopsis contains ""대학 시간강사인 고윤주""**: The query uses a `WHERE` clause to filter for synopses containing the specified text.
2. **Directed by ""봉준호""**: The query filters for movies directed by ""봉준호"" using a `WHERE` clause and a relationship traversal.
3. **Acted by ""이성재""**: The query filters for movies where ""이성재"" acted using a `WHERE` clause and a relationship traversal.
4. **Synopsis is longer than 100 characters**: The query filters for synopses with a text length greater than 100 characters using a `WHERE` clause.

The query returns the titles of the matching movies.

This Cypher query retrieves movies that satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Synopsis contains ""대학 시간강사인 고윤주"":** The query matches movies that have a `HAS_SYNOPSIS` relationship to a `Synopsis` node where the `text` property contains the phrase ""대학 시간강사인 고윤주"".
2. **Directed by ""봉준호"":** The query further filters the movies to include only those that have a `DIRECTED_BY` relationship to a `Director` node with the `name` property ""봉준호"".
3. **""이성재"" acted:** The query ensures that the movie has an `ACTED_BY` relationship to an `Actor` node with the `name` property ""이성재"".
4. **Synopsis shorter than 500 characters:** The query filters the movies to include only those whose `Synopsis` node has a `text` property with a length less than 500 characters.

The query uses multiple `MATCH` clauses to navigate the graph, `WHERE` clauses to filter the results based on the specified conditions, and a `RETURN` clause to return the `title` of the movies that satisfy all the conditions.

   - Features the actor ""최민식"".

3. **Director Criteria:**
   - The director has also directed movies featuring both ""최민식"" and ""이성재"".
   - The director has also directed movies with a synopsis starting with ""대학"" and ending with ""버"".

The query accomplishes this by:

- **MATCHing** nodes for movies, synopses, actors, and directors.
- **WHERE** clauses filter these nodes based on the criteria described above.
- **RETURN**ing the titles of movies that satisfy all conditions.

We need to find movies that have synopses containing specific words and phrases, feature certain actors, and were directed by directors who have also directed movies with overlapping characteristics.

1. **Synopsis Conditions:**
   - The synopsis must contain the word ""시간강사""
   - The synopsis must start with ""대학"" and end with ""버""
   - The synopsis must contain the word ""추천""
   - The synopsis must contain the phrase ""교수직 추천""

3. **Director Conditions:**
   - The director of the movie must have also directed movies that feature ""최민식"" and ""이성재""
   - These other movies directed by the same director must also have synopses that:
     - Start with ""대학"" and end with ""버""
     - Contain the word ""추천""
     - Contain the phrase ""돈 잘 버""
     - Contain the phrase ""교수직 추천""

We will achieve this by:

- **Matching movies:** Start by matching movies that satisfy the synopsis conditions and feature ""최민식"".
- **Matching directors:**  Identify directors who have directed movies satisfying the conditions outlined above.
- **Filtering movies:** Filter the initially matched movies to include only those directed by the identified directors.

   - `text CONTAINS '추천'`: The synopsis must contain the word ""추천"".
   - `text CONTAINS '교수직 추천'`: The synopsis must contain the phrase ""교수직 추천"".

2. **Actor Criteria:**
   - `m.ACTED_BY.name = '최민식'`: The movie must be acted by ""최민식"".

3. **Director Criteria:**
   - `d.DIRECTED_BY.name = '최민식'`: The movie must be directed by a director who has directed movies featuring ""최민식"".
   - `d.DIRECTED_BY.name = '이성재'`: The movie must be directed by a director who has directed movies featuring ""이성재"".

This query identifies movies that meet a complex set of criteria related to their synopses, actors, directors, and other movies they are connected to.  Here's the breakdown:

1. **Matching Movies:** We start by matching movies (`m`) that have a synopsis (`s`) containing the word ""시간강사"" and feature the actor ""최민식"".
2. **Filtering Synopses:** We further filter these movies based on their synopses:
    - The synopsis must start with ""대학"" and end with ""버"".
    - The synopsis must contain the word ""추천"".
    - The synopsis must contain the phrase ""교수직 추천"".
3. **Matching Directors:** The query then matches directors (`d`) who have directed movies (`m1`) that feature ""최민식"" and ""이성재"".
4. **Filtering Directors:** We filter these directors further by ensuring that they have also directed movies (`m2`) that meet the following criteria:
    - The synopsis of `m2` must start with ""대학"" and end with ""버"".
    - The synopsis of `m2` must contain the word ""추천"".
    - The synopsis of `m2` must contain the phrase ""돈 잘 버"".
    - The movie `m2` must feature the actor ""최민식"".
    - The movie `m2` must have a synopsis containing the phrase ""교수직 추천"".
5. **Final Filtering:** Finally, we ensure that the director (`d`) has directed the movie (`m`) we initially matched.
6. **Returning Movies:**  The query returns the titles of the movies (`m.title`) that meet all these criteria.

This query demonstrates how to use multiple MATCH, WHERE, and WITH clauses to progressively filter and refine the results based on complex relationships and properties within the graph.
